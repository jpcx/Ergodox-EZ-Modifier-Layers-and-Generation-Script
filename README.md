# [Separated Modifier Layers & Vim](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/9wlwj)

This is the repository for my personal Ergodox EZ layout.

I wanted different layers for each modifier chord so I wrote a script that populates layers with chorded keymaps.

If you would like to try this kind of configuration just modify the three constants in the script.
